# 📌 Project-4: Credit Risk Analysis: Machine Learning & Tableau Insights

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on **credit risk analysis**, where we leverage **machine learning models** to predict loan applicant behavior based on various financial and demographic factors. The project includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation**, along with **interactive Tableau visualizations** to explore key insights.

## 🚀 Features:

🔄 **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**:

  - Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using statistical summaries and visualizations.

🤖 **Machine Learning Model Training**:

  - Implementing multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  - Training on cleaned and normalized data for improved predictive performance.

🎯 **Model Evaluation & Optimization**:

  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

- 📊 **Tableau Visualizations**:

  - Interactive dashboards highlighting applicant loan behavior, payment trends, and default probabilities.
